,"Survey Evaluation: “What Should I Change in My Patch?”
An Empirical Investigation of Relevant Changes and Automation Needs in Modern Code Review

Question 1.2 ""Does the taxonomy covers all changes that occur in code reviews?""",,
,,,
Participant ID,Occupation,Feedback,New Taxonomy Category
participant_1,Industrial Developer,"- One thing I miss is cleanup/refactoring of the actual git commit graph, e.g. interactive rebase, squashing etc. (depending on team conventions)
- even though this is covered by ""non-source files"" -> ""config files"" -> ""others"" I would consider adding runtime configuration (docker configs, ansible playbooks, deployment configs) as a separate item in config section",-
participant_2,Other Occupation,"It's quite comprehensive, but I don't think it can or even should be exhaustive. Also, I don't agree with some terminology used; like what is source code and what is ""outside"". In my opinion a lot more files belong to the application's source. Example: config files or library versions to build the application.",-
participant_3,Industrial Developer,typos,-
participant_4,Other Occupation,Style and logic,-
participant_7,CS Student,Perhaps it's included in Larger Defects: Completeness but I think that many good code reviews are covering edge cases and that the solution is covering the whole problem. --> Maybe that part could be expanded.,-
participant_12,Industrial Developer,"How would you categorize a review comment like 'This function needs log messages'? Maybe that's 'New Functionality' (if there aren't logging statements already), maybe it's 'Standard Coding Conventions' (if there's a logging standard for the project), maybe there should also be a 'Logging' category as there is for Testing.",Logging
participant_14,Senior Researcher,"I think the taxonomy covers a good part of the code reviewing process, but you could add something about ""versioning"".  I remember when I worked as a software developer, the header of the Java classes should contain the most recent SVN version that they were modified. I know this information could probably be fetched from the SVN itself, but maybe the company wants to quickly identify the latest revision of the file.",-
participant_15,Industrial Developer,One of big types of code change come from side effect of another code change. domino effect has occur (most time in long period of time). ,-
participant_16,CS Student,IMHO: GUI defects are not necessarily large defects,-
participant_18,Senior Researcher,"The changes seem to be oriented on what you would get from a ""diff viewer"", I think you are missing more semantic changes. In my experience, code reviews often result in a change to the system architecture, like splitting an interface into two distinct interfaces, introducing abstractions, or the inclusion of design patterns. These more ""object-oriented"" changes are missing right now in the taxonomy.",Architectural Changes
participant_21,Industrial Developer,"I have to say that the completeness of the taxonomy depends some time on the specific software organization: in general most software software look at the above aspects during code review, however, specific companies could have more specific requirements. Let's for example consider a company working on self-driving cars, in that case code review will require also to observe potential security and or testing issues, an aspect not considered massively in this taxonomy. I would consider to add also changes in the taxonomy that could be relevant also for less general software companies.",Security
participant_26,Senior Researcher,/,-
participant_27,Open Source Developer,"Partially... we mainly care, with the same importance, to
-Documentation and coding style. 
-Architecture patterns.
-Error handling.
-Test coverage. 
-Performance monitoring.
-Security. ",Security
participant_30,Open Source Developer,"Should mention functional or integration testing, where software is integrated as it would be in production, and run against a battery of automated tests.",-
participant_32,Other Occupation,Security is a major aspect,Security
participant_34,Industrial Developer,maybe security is something we care also..,Security
participant_37,Industrial Developer,"performance and security are missing i think, Is ASATs static analysis? In some cases the acronyms do not help understanding what actually there is in the taxonomy.",Security
