TASK1

I focused my attention, in the short time that I had,
in fixing the LongParameterList issues in TimeDurationTests.
Thus, providing a test/class configuration under in TimeDurationTests.

TASK2

I found very difficult with the time allocated to split and improve test methods. 
However,  I have fixed also here the LongParameterList issues in UtilCacheTests by changing
the object under test.
