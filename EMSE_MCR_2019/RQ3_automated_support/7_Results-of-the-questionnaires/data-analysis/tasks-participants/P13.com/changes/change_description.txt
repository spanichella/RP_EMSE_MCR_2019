TASK1:

In summary I have changed for FlexibleStringExpanderTests
 doFseTest (i.e., split it into multiple (2) methods).
For TimeDurationTests it was needed to created a new class containing the whole set of
  parameters of assertDurationFields (done a similar operation for assertDurationLoop)
Finally, I have also split assertDurationLoop into multiple (2) methods.


TASK2:
For the second task i have decided to UtilCacheTests fix the
 the LongMethod in basicTest(), splitting the test in multiple one.
Finally, for assertKey(), as done for doFseTest I have removed the 
LongParameterList issue.
