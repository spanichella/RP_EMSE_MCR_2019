TASK1:

Removing parameters from fseTest and doFseTest methods by deducing values from
other parameter values;
Should split testParsing and everythingTest in different tests (not done because time
budget of 30 min exceeded);
Replacing years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds by TimeDuration
object in parameter list;
Splitting testDuration in several tests (not Qnished because time budget of 30 min
exceeded).

TASK2:

Splitting method fmaTest by extracting parts of code on fmaGet, fmaGetAscending,
fmaGetDescending, and fmaPut;
Nohting in UtilCacheTests, I suspect that method basicTest is too long, but I do not see
how to reduce it.
