TASK1

Split eager tests;
Replace Long Parameter lists with a test configuration under
test for TimeDurationTests;

TASK2

Several eager tests exists in both cases. In some cases it is not easy to break them down
because the ]xture is not set properly in advance. So ]rst setting up the ]xture is
required, and then separating the long tests which test for many assertions, bringing
down the performance. Again I have replaced Long Parameter lists by changing
the object under test for UtilCacheTests;
