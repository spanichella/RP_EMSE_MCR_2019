TASK1

In FlexibleStringExpanderTests i have created a data class that contains the
set of parameters passed to doFseTest; then i have split doFseTest into two methods reporting
 about half of the original test each.
In TimeDurationTests I have create a data class that contains the parameters passed to
assertDurationFields, same for TimeDurationData; finally, i have split assertDurationLoop 
into 3 methods.

TASK2

1 In FlexibleMapAccessorTests i have created a data class, thus
refactored  fmaTest method (after introducing the new
object).

2 in UtilCacheTests, I was not entirely sure how to proceed, but
    i have again created a new class containing the list of parameters passed to assertKey
Then i moved most of tes code from basicTest to 2 novel test methods.
