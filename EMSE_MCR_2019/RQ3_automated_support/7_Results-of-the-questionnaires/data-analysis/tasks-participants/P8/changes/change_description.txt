TASK1

(1) I reduced the parameters used in fseTest, doFseTest, assertDuration and assertDurationLoop methods by introducing
 new objects to pass all the data, this to reduce the number of parameters
needed in the methods. I tried to replaced testDuration with several tests (to reduce its length).

TASK2

 I have refactored  fmaTest method (introducing a new
object to reduce the parameter numbers and  extracting some part of the test code
in a new test method to reduce the length of the code).
(2) in UtilCacheTests, I was not sure how to proceed. 
    In any case  I removed some duplicated assertions sin basicTest
    method to reduce its length.
