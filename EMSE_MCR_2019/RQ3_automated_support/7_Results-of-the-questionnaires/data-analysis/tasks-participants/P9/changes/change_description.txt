TASK1:

In FlexibleStringExpanderTests.java I have decided to split doFseTest into 2 methods
Considering TimeDurationTests I have created a class 
DataOfDurationParams to incapsulate all parameters passed to assertDurationFields. 
In addition I have create data class DataOfTimeDuration to incapsulate all parameters passed to
assertDurationLoop and split assertDurationLoop into two methods.


TASK2:
For what concerns UtilCacheTests.java
	I have  detected and removed the LongMethod problem affecting basicTest(UtilCache) - split it.
	Again for  assertKey() I have  detected and removed the LongParameterList problem
	incapsulating the many parameters in one Object.
