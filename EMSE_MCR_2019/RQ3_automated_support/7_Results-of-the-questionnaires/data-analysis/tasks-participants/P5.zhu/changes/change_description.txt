TASK1

(1) I introduced new objects to pass all the data to reduce the number of parameters
needed in the methods (in doFseTest, assertDurationFields, assertDurationLoop, and
assertDuration). (2) I extracted the same lines to a new method to reduce the duplication
(in doFseTest).

task2

(1) in FlexibleMapAccessorTests, I refactored the fmaTest method: 1.1) introduced new
object to reduce the parameter numbers in this method; 1.2) extracted part of the code
to a new test method to reduce the length of the code.
(2) in UtilCacheTests, I removed some duplicated assertion statements in basicTest
method.
