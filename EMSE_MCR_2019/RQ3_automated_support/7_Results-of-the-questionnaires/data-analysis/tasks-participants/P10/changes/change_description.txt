TASK1

(1) The strategy I decided to use for reducing the high number of parameters used in 
    "fseTest()- doFseTest() - assertDuration() and assertDurationLoop()" test methods
    is to incapsulate such parameters in new objects. 
    In the case of testDuration I decided to replaced it with  multiple tests, this
    to reduce its overal length.

TASK2

 (2) As done in (1) I have introduced a new
     object to reduce the number of parameters for "fmaTest() test method".
     Finally for UtilCacheTests I refactored some assertions (I found some duplicated one) 
     in basicTest.
