showing where similar code was used / where the same thing is happening;"
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_8,Open Source Developer,#NAME?
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_9,Senior Researcher,where to jump to
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_10,Senior Researcher,"Of two type, first i would like to know which changes are/will be required for the code review session. This would be useful to estimate the work required 
 to perform the required changes."
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_11,Industrial Developer,"I would like some ranking of the severity of the issue, which could be set at the beginning of the project. Like that, I could prioritise on the issues."
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_12,Industrial Developer,Specifics about changes needed in the code.
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_13,Other Occupation,Suggestions related to possible code changes aimed to fix the problem
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_14,Senior Researcher,"maybe some clear suggestions of what am I missing in my proposed solution, such as how can I optimize the memory usage or if I am following the code style that should be adopted"
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_15,Industrial Developer,refactoring
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_16,CS Student,"Change suggestions for simple automatable fixes (e.g., alike a pull request)"
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_17,CS Student,"Static analysis suggestions but additionally check comments and documentation is available, function calls and nesting, check complexity.. Give concrete suggestions what should be changed..."
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_18,Senior Researcher,"I do not understand the question. I think what I get right now is the result of the build, i.e., how is the test coverage, are there style warnings, does the code compile, etc. This is all I need."
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_19,Other Occupation,"I would expect simpler checks, like the ones about style especially, or coding conventions, that could be embedded in a recommender and be project dependent"
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_20,Industrial Developer,"To be honest, I don't see how an automatic recommender tool can help me since I see the code review process as a communication platform between teammates. The human element is essential. However, it would be cool to get recommendations regarding the coding standards that are adopted by the team."
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_21,Industrial Developer,"This is not a simple question, I think that, beside tools suggesting how to improve structure/style/documentation it would be great to have tools, anticipating the process of change. Very often during after submitting a patch, I have to wait some ""unproductive"" time before getting a feedback on my code. it would be in general useful to have tool that instantaneously provide me high- and low-level feedback on my code."
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_22,Senior Researcher,I think automation in code review is also difficult to imagine to me. Maybe because I mainly to face to face code review and my team is non so large. Probably in more industrial context tools for collaborative code review and for automating some of its activity is an important requirement.
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_23,Senior Researcher,N.A
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_24,Industrial Developer,"Manual code reviews will still be done. But tool for Code Review are not  thorough enough to catch all the common problems a senior developer detect during a manual review. But from tools, I would expect in the same way feedback encapsulating aspects related to coding or documentation styles, recommendations regarding configuration of tools, and possible, reference to alternative solution to a given problem (e.g., from StackOverflow or other sources)."
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_25,Senior Researcher,code duplication problem
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_26,Senior Researcher,"Dead code analysis, duplication"
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_27,Open Source Developer,"recommendation on:
-Documentation and coding style for sure
-Architecture patterns. - structure would be great,
-Error handling and defects - but I think this is difficult
-Test coverage and test quality perhaps..
-Performance monitoring (did I have added a performance bug in my change?)
-Security  (did I have added a security issue in my change?)"
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_28,Industrial Developer,"Feedback on production and test code for quality issues (e.g., 
structure, coverage, suggestions on how to refactoring production and test code, etc.), documentation & coding style and possibly performance issues."

Q2.1,feedback_recommender_33,Industrial Developer,"interface, logic, resources, security aspect, feedback on how to improve performance of my code (if possible), quality of test and production code...
usually structure, style/documentation are easier to detect and developers are more prone to give feedback on this."
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_34,Industrial Developer,"possibly feedback on all issues related to doc/style/structure, interface, logic, resource, security, check large defect, configuration ASATs and CD/CI scripts"
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_35,Industrial Developer,"I think tools should be able to recognize, from the last change what shoul be the focus of the review: if I change somethig, he tools should give me feedback on what I have to change, add and or improve/delete."
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_36,Industrial Developer,"would be could on the structure and quality of my code first, then on the performance of it, the less critical stuff, like doc/style/structure."
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_37,Industrial Developer,"again , feedback on performance, security, style, documentation, logic"
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_38,Industrial Developer,"for sure on doc, style structure, resource, large defects."
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_39,Industrial Developer,"anything could be automated, without waiting feedback of other developers: doc, styl, structure, interface,  resources. I guess logic  and large defects are difficult to automate."
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_40,Industrial Developer,"would be nice feedback on how to improve my style, structure, and quality of tests"
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_41,Industrial Developer,Comments on certain lines of code were improvement is possible.
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_42,Industrial Developer,"possibly feedback on the required changes, especially on the one that i usually do not receive feedback.."

Q2.1,feedback_recommender_44,Industrial Developer,"feedback on the quality of my test and production code, as quell as in doc, structure, resource, other changes, resources :)"
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_45,Industrial Developer,"I would aspect tools recommending what to improve in my code, for example suggesting refactoring operations to simplify my code, too complex and too difficult pat of my code (the logic is too difficult too get), detect redundant/cloned/useless code (to simplify it)."
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_46,CS Student,to improve my code

Q2.1,feedback_recommender_51,Open Source Developer,do not know/do not want to say
Q2.1,feedback_recommender_52,Industrial Developer,"on other changes (configuration cd/ci and static analysis tools), resources, logic, check, structure, as developers usually provide feedback on structure and documentation. "
Q2.2,envision_automation_1,Industrial Developer,Machine-Learning code-review bot that is trained by the manual code review process and can later on (with enough training data) be used to pre-screen changesets - possibly identifying a lot of possible issues before any human reviews the code.
Q2.2,envision_automation_2,Other Occupation,"I really do not understand the question; what do you mean by ""what kind of automation""? Sorry that I cannot be of any help here"
Q2.2,envision_automation_3,Industrial Developer,"Remove unused code
Replace deprecated code when possible, otherwise fail the build"
Q2.2,envision_automation_4,Other Occupation,Style should be corrected and logic highlighted
Q2.2,envision_automation_5,Senior Researcher,"Checking, for example, if I am using the same name conventions of the codebase"

Q2.2,envision_automation_8,Open Source Developer,"- Similar Code --> Refactoring suggestion
- Pattern recognition and also some suggestion for setup the correct pattern
- automated Documentation generation would be really cool=)"
Q2.2,envision_automation_9,Senior Researcher,defect prediction and property level estimation for blocks of code
Q2.2,envision_automation_10,Senior Researcher,"On the style: would be interesting to have a tool for evaluating my style consistency with respect to the whole project (the style applied in the organization). 

documentation: documentation is usually not update and often incomplete. it would be great to have some automation to highlight the most relevant change that are needed to make it more complete and/or less inconsistent with the test/production code.

structure: it would be also interesting to get feedback 
- on the introduced  duplicated-dead code, 
- test/code smells (bad design choices) added and/or overal test/code quality and readability in general. 
etc.

Possibly recommendation on 
- runtime configurations,
 - data & resource utilisation."
Q2.2,envision_automation_11,Industrial Developer,Something very similar to static analysis tools (e.g. clang-tidy for C++).
Q2.2,envision_automation_12,Industrial Developer,"I'd hope for a tool that would compare variables, statements and function calls not only against syntax definitions but against similar variables, statements and function calls from the codebase being changed, enabling a developer to adapt to local naming customs, and to see (and match) existing examples of the code being reviewed. "
Q2.2,envision_automation_13,Other Occupation,Something integrated with the development environment that is able to recognize the problems during the insertion and not later on
Q2.2,envision_automation_14,Senior Researcher,I expect the automation of the style and (to some extent) documentation issues. it would also be nice to automate the organization of the proposed solution. I am not sure if it is possible to automate the solution itself.
Q2.2,envision_automation_15,Industrial Developer,strong naming suggestion. I think we can have word-net for naming or something like it.
Q2.2,envision_automation_16,CS Student,Fix linter style warnings
Q2.2,envision_automation_17,CS Student,automatically fix basic and common issue (e.g. style and documenation) or give suggestions.
Q2.2,envision_automation_18,Senior Researcher,"I do not think that the process of code review is automatable. The easy things like test coverage or style breaks can already be checked easily with state-of-the-art tools like Maven, the rest does not follow easy to formulate rules and depends a lot on experience."
Q2.2,envision_automation_19,Other Occupation,I'd like an automation pointing out to developers whether and where they have written highly inefficient code (like implementation with high space or time complexity)
Q2.2,envision_automation_20,Industrial Developer,"I think a tool that can automatically recognize team ""culture"" and detect deviation from it, would be helpful in the reviewing process. By team culture I mean how team members name variables, where they put functionalities, how they document their code, and so on. "
Q2.2,envision_automation_21,Industrial Developer,"I would like to have a summary of all required changes in my patch. Usually, depending on the reviewers experience and skills you get different types of feedback. It would be great to have a comprehensive tool that provide all these feedback in one shot, maybe prioritized or ranked according to the priorities/policies of the organization."
Q2.2,envision_automation_22,Senior Researcher," I would try to understand which problems are recurrent in code reviews, e.g.,  defining patterns and anti-patterns characterizing the ""code review process and collaborations"".  The I would automatically leverage tools for detecting such anti-patterns to highlight potential problems. Many of problems we face during code review are related to the miss match between expectations and outcomes of a code review. Reviewer provide feedback that are not exhaustive or timely reported. This makes often code reviews unproductive. A simple automation toward this direction could be predicting the required code review changes."
Q2.2,envision_automation_23,Senior Researcher,N.A
Q2.2,envision_automation_24,Industrial Developer," I would expect  static tools profiling my changes and providing me feedback encapsulating aspects related to coding or documentation styles, recommendations regarding configuration of tools, and possible, reference to alternative solution to a given problem (e.g., from StackOverflow or other sources). Clearly, even recommendation on the general required changes on a submitted patch would be really useful in my opinion."
Q2.2,envision_automation_25,Senior Researcher,change explanation
Q2.2,envision_automation_26,Senior Researcher,"Mostly regarding style, interface, organization"
Q2.2,envision_automation_27,Open Source Developer,"It would be great to have automation that not only provide information on the performed change, but actually predict issues and/or is able to answer the following questions automatically:

- did I have introduced imperfections at the level of documentation and coding style..?
- did I have introduced imperfections at the level of Architecture patterns. ?
- did I have introduced imperfections at the level of Error handling and defects?
- did I have introduced imperfections at the level of Test coverage and test quality?
- did I have added a performance bug in my change?
- did I have added a security bug in my change?

Clearly having the location (e.g., the set of files) where the problem was introduced would be relevant too..
"
Q2.2,envision_automation_28,Industrial Developer,"Let me say that I would like automated feedback on production and test code for quality issues (e.g.,  structure, coverage, suggestions on how to refactoring production and test code, etc.), documentation & coding style and possibly performance issues; Performance and Security issues

From one side code and code changes metrics + code change patters 
would a useful information to study previous changes in the software and its documentation to learn more about upcoming (and recurrent) mistakes.
I would mine this information with some data mining techniques and machine learning to learn these patterns and/or identify some of the problems.
Ont top of this, I think auto-fixing strategies could be envisioned.

I'm a cloud developers, i.e., I dealing with cloud native (or aware) applications.
In my context, I have to dealing with several
- code and test quality checks
- performance issues; 
- security issues;
- etc.

It would be great to have tool measuring the cloud ""nativeness"" of my application, for example can we in code review  test or verify properties like ""resiliency, elasticity, low-coupling of microservices?"" This would be really useful for us and is something not available at code review and testing level."
Q2.2,envision_automation_29,Senior Researcher,Auto check my code for styling and for potential logical or integration issues.
Q2.2,envision_automation_30,Open Source Developer,"Before merge into the development/master branch, verification with a battery of tests (coverage/unit tests/integration tests/linting), and reported in a way that can be easily comprehended. "
Q2.2,envision_automation_31,Industrial Developer,Finding code paths that are not tested and highlighting for easy viewing. Finding places where a variable is prone to mutation where it should be copied to avoid bugs.
Q2.2,envision_automation_32,Other Occupation,Security
Q2.2,envision_automation_33,Industrial Developer,"solutions summarizing the main problem affecting my patch, thus not a single individual feedback in one aspect, I would use some static analysis, novel metrics and summarization techniques for generating feedback related to:

interface, logic, resources, security aspect, feedback on how to improve performance of my code (if possible), quality of test and production code...

"
Q2.2,envision_automation_34,Industrial Developer,"an unified tools that provides feedback that senior developers would give me in practice, but on all issues related to doc/style/structure, interface, logic, resource, security, check large defect, configuration ASATs and CD/CI scripts"
Q2.2,envision_automation_35,Industrial Developer,"something that support me to focus on the minimal changes required for that specific review,. Each review has its own story and minimizing the feedback to the one that are relevant would be ideal to reduce the time of the review process"
Q2.2,envision_automation_36,Industrial Developer,"automation should consider more recent concept of CD, CI, and automated testing, summarization techniques, thus providing feedback on: the way a CD/CI pipeline is structured or is efficient, when the test is not of good quality suggest replacement of test suite or test methods. Summarization techniques could be useful to provide all these information in an unified manner."
Q2.2,envision_automation_37,Industrial Developer,I would define lightweight (not expensive metrics to compute) metrics to measure performance aspects..
Q2.2,envision_automation_38,Industrial Developer,"automation aimed at proposing solutions to issues like doc, style structure, resource, large defects. I would imagine an automation that provide different solutions, but developers can select the best one."
Q2.2,envision_automation_39,Industrial Developer,"something to detect, logic imperfection compared for example the actual documentation, detection performance/resource issues, and autofixes for more common problems related to doc, style, structure"
Q2.2,envision_automation_40,Industrial Developer,"something that leverage automatic test cases generation strategies to produce better tests, or provide replacement for tests submitted for review or roviding feedback on the quality of my test code."
Q2.2,envision_automation_41,Industrial Developer,In line sugestions while developing.
Q2.2,envision_automation_42,Industrial Developer,"something that give me feedback on what improve in the artefact composing my patch, like an automated CodeReviewDoctor analyzing my patch and providing feedback on the status of the patch itself and what to change of it. This by analyzing the introduced changes, added files, etc."
Q2.2,envision_automation_43,Industrial Developer,for example lightweight metrics highlighting whether my code introduced performance issues.
Q2.2,envision_automation_44,Industrial Developer,"a comprehensive tools highlighting the changes to to perform or the defects introduced while introducing  (or evolving)  my patch, this would be really helpful."
Q2.2,envision_automation_45,Industrial Developer,"As recommendation, I think refactorings in Code reviews should not only consider the degree of cohesion and coupling between classes only, it should also consider the degree of comprehensibility of the test and production code.

Refactoring operations should be recommended in order to simplify the way the logic of the system is implemented (removing too complex branch and conditional statements, etc.). Thus, metrics modelling, readability,  logic and comprehensibility of implemented test and production code is something desirable.

Tool recommenting the files to potentially modify maybe also specifying the specific change to perform. I think this should be possible wish some historical analysis of changes.

Recomending reviewers according to their code ownership, the fact that they introduced previous similar changes (or similar structural or semantic clones).
Having reviwers that have implemented similar stuff would be useful to detect redundant/cloned/useless code to simplify it.

Tool to directly detect redundant/cloned/useless code to simplify it.


"
Q2.2,envision_automation_46,CS Student,not sure about it.
Q2.2,envision_automation_47,Open Source Developer,"on the configuration level would be great to have tool suggesting
what to change over the time. For example when configuring a CD and CI pipelines, what i need to change to improve the overall developers productivity and development process. We would need metrics measuring the efficiency of a CD/CI pipeline and then understand which configuration and/or steps of the pipeline could be optimized at the configuration level. 
"
Q2.2,envision_automation_48,Industrial Developer,"as cloud developers, something to ensure the quality of my cloud applications,
in terms of performance and software quality. Thus, tools, giving me feedback on the quality of my patch, whether a new version of my patch improved in the aspects mentioned in the taxonomy. Thus, some automation based on static/dynamic analysis to provide me such information."

Q2.3,automation_doc_1,Industrial Developer,"check completeness and correctness of javadoc tags with respect to rules defined by team (we try to avoid in-code documentation altogether, instead making the code easily readable to a point where javadoc is superfluous - so that's rather irrelevant for us. IDEs/compilers can already perform the tedious correctness checks if told to do so). A nice addition would be spell-checking, maybe providing suggested fixes."

Q2.3,automation_doc_12,Industrial Developer,A diff between the source and the documentation that listed definitions that needed to be written up in the documentation.
Q2.3,automation_doc_13,Other Occupation,"As regards comments, something that is able to properly determine the goal of the entity that needs to be commented; as regard naming something that is able to suggest a proper name to assign to an entity based on the naming conventions."
Q2.3,automation_doc_14,Senior Researcher,"in Terms of Java, I would expect that the tool could help generating the javadocs,  the license header, fix the naming conventions if possible, propose some comments (maybe templates), suggest the right modifiers. Pretty much everything."

Q2.3,automation_doc_35,Industrial Developer,"for example,  detection and auto-fix are still not available for code review, but they should be suggested only when this is relevant for the review. Metrics based on static, dynamic analysis or detection strategies based on some nlp a alysis and similar approaches would be useful here I guess."

Q2.5,automation_structure_45,Industrial Developer,"As wrote before.

As recommendation, I think refactorings in Code reviews should not only consider the degree of cohesion and coupling between classes only, it should also consider the degree of comprehensibility of the test and production code.

Refactoring operations should be recommended in order to simplify the way the logic of the system is implemented (removing too complex branch and conditional statements, etc.). Thus, metrics modelling, readability,  logic and comprehensibility of implemented test and production code is something desirable.

Tool recommenting the files to potentially modify maybe also specifying the specific change to perform. I think this should be possible wish some historical analysis of changes.

Recomending reviewers according to their code ownership, the fact that they introduced previous similar changes (or similar structural or semantic clones).
Having reviwers that have implemented similar stuff would be useful to detect redundant/cloned/useless code to simplify it.

Metrics, dynamic/performance/static analysis, summarization techniques could be useful to provide all these information in an unified manner."
Q2.7,automation_suggestions_37,Industrial Developer,I would define lightweight (not expensive metrics to compute) metrics to measure of detect  the issues.
Q2.7,automation_suggestions_38,Industrial Developer,"empirical analysis, usage of nlp, static analysis, dynamic analysis,  definition of new metrics, studying recurrent patterns on how to model, detect and propose fixes for doc, style structure, resource, large defects.  - Then the developers can keep the solutions they prefer."
Q2.7,automation_suggestions_39,Industrial Developer,"I would try to analyze code and other changes from the history of the project, detecting, metrics patterns, anti-patterns, thus predicting required changes, or recommending solution when possible."
Q2.7,automation_suggestions_40,Industrial Developer,"Recommendation of potential solutions: something that leverage automatic test cases generation strategies to produce better tests, or provide replacement for tests submitted for review or providing feedback on the quality of my test code. For other problems: detection of recurrent problems and auto-fixes (or recommendation of potential solutions?)."
Q2.7,automation_suggestions_41,Industrial Developer,Regex through code.
Q2.7,automation_suggestions_42,Industrial Developer,"As mentioned before, something that give me feedback on what improve in the artefact composing my patch, like an automated CodeReviewDoctor analyzing my patch and providing feedback on the status of the patch itself and what to change of it. This by analyzing the introduced changes, added files, etc.
- A fully automated solution should provide feedback on the change to perform,
- then a semi-automated approach should be enacted on top of the CodeReviewDoctor or CodeReviewChangeDetector,  something like a CodeReviewChangeGenerator that provide potential solution to integrate in the current patch."
Q2.7,automation_suggestions_43,Industrial Developer,"for example lightweight metrics highlighting whether my code introduced performance issues., or recurrent issues in configuration files."
Q2.7,automation_suggestions_44,Industrial Developer,"build a comprehensive tool highlighting the changes to perform or the defects introduced in the documentation, while introducing (or evolving) my patch. This would require a tool analysing the code and other software artifacts changes from the first version of the patch and over the time, until the patch is ready to be submitted to the master repository. The tools should monitor  specific and evolving characteristics of the patch providing feedback on what improved over the time and what do not. Metrics based on code change analysis would be one solutions, but they should be provided in an unified manner."
Q2.7,automation_suggestions_45,Industrial Developer,"I think I have explained a bit how I would approach this. I would use the notion of patterns, antipatterns to also fix/handle problems on resource consumption of my code, something not available in code review practices."
Q2.7,automation_suggestions_46,CS Student,not sure about it.
Q2.7,automation_suggestions_47,Open Source Developer,"on the configuration level would be great to have tool suggesting
what to change over the time. For example when configuring a CD and CI pipelines, what i need to change to improve the overall developers productivity and development process. We would need metrics measuring the efficiency of a CD/CI pipeline and then understand which configuration and/or steps of the pipeline could be optimized at the configuration level. "
Q2.7,automation_suggestions_48,Industrial Developer,I think i have discussed it already in previous questions.
